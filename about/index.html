Even though I am doing what I love as my career, it's honestly kinda boring in a job setting, especially when you just work on stuff that you're not interested in or when it feels like a chore. Due to these reasons, I have dropped all of that, taking on a completely risky route of starting a company on my own which has been a goal since I was a kid.<p>The company is called <a href=https://lyminal.space/>Lyminal</a>, derived from the word <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal>Liminal</a> and my interest in the phenomenon "Liminal Space".<h2 id=what-do-i-do>What Do I Do?</h2><p>I basically have this list where I write down random ideas and thoughts, most of them utterly ridiculous but I gotta say, some of them just might be pretty good... prolly. The list is so long, I wouldn't be able to strike off all of them in my lifetime but all in all, I pick one and do it whenever I feel like it. I don't go by any schedule.<p>If you want formal talk, I work in the field of Systems Programming and Infosec where I implement/write high-performance, scalable, and secure software for companies. Expanding on my Security Research work, I have found and patched several CVEs in open-source projects and have secured numerous organizations via Response Disclosure or via Bug Bounty programs.<p>Here's my GitHub if you wanna have a look at some code crimes: <a href=https://github.com/mufeedvh target=_blank><span class="fa-brands fa-github"></span> github/mufeedvh</a>.<h2 id=technical-skills>Technical Skills</h2><p>I mostly write code in Rust and Python, other than that, I dabble with C, C++, Go, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Zig, and Nim. (I like learning languages for fun even though I merely use a few)<p>I have an interest in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory>Programming language theory</a> especially in implementing parser generators and JIT engines. Talking about programming languages, I have written a bizarre programming language called <a href=https://github.com/mufeedvh/regretti>regretti</a> as part of <a href=https://github.com/langjam/langjam>Lang Jam</a> in 48 hours that takes ascii art flow charts as first-class citizen which won the competition and got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7VAw8UfMeA&t=466s">featured in the results video</a>.<p>I have done most work in the field of Systems Programming, Android Security, Web Security, Game Development, Cryptography, and Operating Systems.<p>You can take a look at some of my open-source work on my <a href=projects>Projects</a> page.<p>That's about it.</p><script>function me_when(){var date_of_birth=(new Date()) - (new Date(2002, 6, 13)); date_of_birth /= (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365); document.getElementById('my_age').innerHTML='<span>' + Math.floor(date_of_birth) + '</span>.' + (date_of_birth % 1).toFixed(9).substr(2);}setInterval(me_when, 1)</script></div><div class="section bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/posts>posts</a> 路 <a href=/about>about</a> 路 <a href=/projects>projects</a> 路 <a href=/contact>contact</a> 路 <a href=https://mufeedvh.com> home </a></div></div>
