I also get to legally hack them sometimes which is fun.<hr><p><strong>Q.</strong> How did you get started?<p><strong>A.</strong> Used to play this multiplayer mobile game called <a href=https://doodlearmy2.fandom.com/wiki/Doodle_Army_2:_Mini_Militia>Doodle Army 2: Mini Militia</a> with my neighbour friends. One day, one of the neighbour friends cheated at the game using a modded version of it. I wanted to know how it was made instead of just downloading it. Tracked down the guy who made it on a forum, after months of dumbassery (learning reverse engineering), I figured it out and started doing the same. My mods of the game under a pseudonym were pretty popular, 15 year old me just did it for fun.<p>Now I am trapped doing the same thing for a living cus nothing else gave me the type of rush and excitement as making/breaking things with a computer... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIrptvrlrPE">it makes my heart go fast</a>.<hr><p><strong>Q.</strong> What about your academics?<p><strong>A.</strong> I am a high school dropout (12th grade). I figured out how to go without it at 17 and with the help of extremely ambitious (more like delusional) plans, I am out of the system. I am an autodidact.<p>Being intentionally vague, my brain isn't wired to sit and listen in a class (in the literal sense). The same thing makes me good at what I do.<p>And if I get the chance, I would like to work on creating/improving the schooling system addressing the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem>Bloom's 2 sigma problem</a> fitting to neurodivergent and neurotypical students alike.<hr><p><strong>Q.</strong> What's your next plan?<p><strong>A.</strong> Have a long list of them; it changes from time to time, when I get bored I choose one of them and do it.<hr><p><strong>Q.</strong> What's your LinkedIn?<p><strong>A.</strong> I am thrilled and excited to share that I do not use LinkedIn. See my <a href=https://github.com/mufeedvh>GitHub</a> instead.<hr><p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the meaning of life?<p><strong>A.</strong> ↓↓↓↓<p><img alt="my goal in life is to convince every cat that i am their friend" src=/faq/cats.jpg width=400></p><script>function me_when() {var date_of_birth = new Date(2002, 5, 13); /* look who's curious about my dob, it's june btw not may cus damn javascript starts the month index at 0 smh  */ var today = new Date(); var age_in_ms = today - date_of_birth; var age_in_years = age_in_ms / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25); document.getElementById('my_age').innerHTML = '' + Math.floor(age_in_years) + '.' + (age_in_years % 1).toFixed(9).substr(2);}setInterval(me_when, 1)</script></div><div class="section bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/posts>posts</a> · <a href=/about>about</a> · <a href=/projects>projects</a> · <a href=/contact>contact</a> · <a href=https://www.mufeedvh.com> home </a> <br><br> <strong style="font-family: 'JetBrains Mono Light'">~ bend the consensus ~</strong></div></div><script integrity=sha384-jnZyxPjiipYXnSU0ygqeac2q7CVYMbh84q0uHVRRxEtvFPiQYbXWUorga2aqZJ0z src=//instant.page/5.2.0 type=module></script>
