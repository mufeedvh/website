Even though I am doing what I love as my career, it's honestly kinda boring in a job setting, especially when you just work on stuff that you're not interested in or when it feels like a chore. Due to these reasons, I have dropped all of that, taking on a completely risky route of starting a company on my own which has been a goal of mine since I was a kid.<p>The company is called <a href=https://lyminal.space/>Lyminal</a>, derived from the word <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal>Liminal</a> and my interest in the phenomenon "Liminal Space".<h2 id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href=https://www.mufeedvh.com/about/#what-i-do>What I Do</a><li><a href=https://www.mufeedvh.com/about/#technical-skills>Technical Skills</a><li><a href=https://www.mufeedvh.com/about/#recent-life-updates>Recent Life Updates</a><li><a href=https://www.mufeedvh.com/about/#not-so-recent-life-updates>Not so recent life updates</a></ul><h2 id=what-i-do>What I Do</h2><p>I basically have this list where I write down random ideas and thoughts, most of them utterly ridiculous but I gotta say, some of them just might be pretty good... prolly. The list is so long, I wouldn't be able to strike off all of them in my lifetime but all in all, I pick one and do it whenever I feel like it. I don't go by any schedule.<p>If you want formal talk, I work in the field of Systems Programming and Infosec where I implement/write high-performance, scalable, and secure software for companies. Expanding on my Security Research work, I have found and patched several <strong>CVEs</strong> in open-source projects and have secured numerous organizations via Response Disclosure or via Bug Bounty programs.<p>I also love winning competitions. I have won WorldSkills (aka The Olympics of Skills), BRICS Skills, and several CTFs, mostly in security.

(I like learning languages for fun even though I merely use a few)<p>I have an interest in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory>Programming language theory</a> especially in implementing parser generators and JIT engines. Talking about programming languages, I have written a bizarre programming language called <a href=https://github.com/mufeedvh/regretti>regretti</a> as part of <a href=https://github.com/langjam/langjam>Lang Jam</a> in 48 hours that takes ascii art flow charts as first-class citizen which won the voter's choice and got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7VAw8UfMeA&t=466s">featured in the results video</a>.<p>I have done most work in the field of Systems Programming, Android Security, Web Security, Game Development, Cryptography, and Operating Systems.<p>You can take a look at some of my open-source work on my <a href=https://www.mufeedvh.com/projects>Projects</a> page.<p>That's about it.<h2 id=recent-life-updates>Recent Life Updates</h2><ul><li>Won Bronze Medal at the <a href=http://en.brskills.com/>BRICS Skills 2022</a> for Cyber Security representing India, it's a Skills competition I participated adjacent to WorldSkills with participations from the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS>BRICS</a> countries: Brazil, India, China, Russia, and South Africa.<li>Won <a href=https://forum.fossunited.org/t/foss-hack-3-0-results/1882>FOSSHack 2023</a> by <a href=https://fossunited.org/>FOSSUnited</a> with our project <a href=https://github.com/DNArchery/DNArchery>DNArchery</a> - A DNA Sequencing/Visualization software for bioinformatics research with my teammates <a href=https://github.com/123vivekr>Vivek R</a> and <a href=https://github.com/vishalkrishnads>Vishal DS</a>.<li>Represented India for Cyber Security at the <a href=https://worldskills.org/>WorldSkills</a> SE 2022 (aka "The Olympics of Skills") held at South Korea and ranked 8th!
