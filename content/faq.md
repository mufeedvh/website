_faqs i made up so it's easier to answer questions._

**Q.** How old are you?

**A.** <span id="my_age"><noscript>20</noscript></span>

----

**Q.** Where are you from?

**A.** My hometown is situated in a very small village in the district of Thrissur belonging to the state of [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala), aka the God's Own Country.

----

**Q.** What do you do for a living?

**A.** Companies reach out to me with hard software problems via [Lyminal Solve](https://lyminal.space/solve/) (my company) and I/we solve it for them. I also get to legally hack them sometimes which is fun.

----

**Q.** How did you get started?

**A.** Used to play this multiplayer mobile game called [Doodle Army 2: Mini Militia](https://doodlearmy2.fandom.com/wiki/Doodle_Army_2:_Mini_Militia) with my neighbour friends. One day, one of the neighbour friends cheated at the game using a modded version of it. I wanted to know how it was made instead of just downloading it. Tracked down the guy who made it on a forum, after months of dumbassery (learning reverse engineering), I figured it out and started doing the same. My mods of the game under a pseudonym were pretty popular, 15 year old me just did it for fun.

Now I am trapped doing the same thing for a living cus nothing else gave me the type of rush and excitement as making/breaking things with a computer... [it makes my heart go fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIrptvrlrPE).

**Q.** What about your academics?

**A.** I am a high school dropout (12th grade). I figured out how to go without it at 17 and with the help of extremely ambitious (more like delusional) plans, I am out of the system. I am an autodidact.

Being intentionally vague, my brain isn't wired to sit and listen in a class (in the literal sense). The same thing makes me good at what I do.

And if I get the chance, I would like to work on creating/improving the schooling system addressing the [Bloom's 2 sigma problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem) fitting to neurodivergent and neurotypical students alike.

----

**Q.** What's your next plan?

**A.** Have a long list of them; it changes from time to time, when I get bored I choose one of them and do it.

----

**Q.** What's your LinkedIn?

**A.** I am thrilled and excited to share that I do not use LinkedIn. See my [GitHub](https://github.com/mufeedvh) instead.

**Q.** What is the meaning of life?

**A.** ↓↓↓↓
