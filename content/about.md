My name's Mufeed, currently <span id="my_age"><noscript>21</noscript></span> years old from Thrissur, Kerala.

I am an avid self-learner and consider myself as an [autodidact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism), almost everything I know has been self-taught by the means of books and the Internet.

I have alternating interests but the only ones that stayed consistent are <strong>coding</strong>, <strong>hacking</strong>, and <strong>art</strong> (which I haven't done in a while).

As a result, coding/hacking is now a fun hobby turned passion which I am grateful to say I make a living out of. Even though I am doing what I love as my career, it's honestly kinda boring in a job setting, especially when you just work on stuff that you're not interested in or when it feels like a chore. Due to these reasons, I have dropped all of that, taking on a completely risky route of starting a company on my own which has been a goal of mine since I was a kid.

The company is called [Lyminal](https://lyminal.space/), derived from the word [Liminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal) and my interest in the phenomenon "Liminal Space".

## What I Do

I basically have this list where I write down random ideas and thoughts, most of them utterly ridiculous but I gotta say, some of them just might be pretty good... prolly. The list is so long, I wouldn't be able to strike off all of them in my lifetime but all in all, I pick one and do it whenever I feel like it. I don't go by any schedule.

If you want formal talk, I work in the field of Systems Programming and Infosec where I implement/write high-performance, scalable, and secure software for companies. Expanding on my Security Research work, I have found and patched several **CVEs** in open-source projects and have secured numerous organizations via Response Disclosure or via Bug Bounty programs.

I also love winning competitions. I have won WorldSkills (aka The Olympics of Skills), BRICS Skills, and several CTFs, mostly in security. (Read more at [recent life updates](#recent-life-updates))

Currently having fun solving hard software problems via [Lyminal Solve](https://lyminal.space/solve/) where companies reach out to me with a hard problem and I solve it for them.

Here's my GitHub if you wanna have a look at some code crimes: <a href="https://github.com/mufeedvh" target="_blank"><span class="fa-brands fa-github"></span> github/mufeedvh</a>.

## Technical Skills

I mostly write code in Rust and Python, other than that, I dabble with C, C++, Go, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Zig, and Nim. (I like learning languages for fun even though I merely use a few)

I have an interest in [Programming language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory) especially in implementing parser generators and JIT engines. Talking about programming languages, I have written a bizarre programming language called [regretti](https://github.com/mufeedvh/regretti) as part of [Lang Jam](https://github.com/langjam/langjam) in 48 hours that takes ascii art flow charts as first-class citizen which won the voter's choice and got [featured in the results video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7VAw8UfMeA&t=466s).

I have done most work in the field of Systems Programming, Android Security, Web Security, Game Development, Cryptography, and Operating Systems.

You can take a look at some of my open-source work on my [Projects](https://www.mufeedvh.com/projects) page.

That's about it.
